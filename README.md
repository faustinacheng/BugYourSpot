# Components 
BugYourSpot's structure derives from Spring Boot Flow Architecture examples, which provide several layers of abstraction between the client 
and the service itself. The client, which is any business that would need to employ some reservation schedule—restaurants, hospitals, the DMV,
and more—can make use of several API endpoints to send certain requests. The paramterized information that the client sends is then parsed
and gradually propagated throughout the various layers, with various elements of error checking occurring at different levels.
